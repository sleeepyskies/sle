# What is sle?
The goal of sle is to create a 2D isometric game engine using SDL. The project is mainly to learn
about how a game engine should be designed.

# What can sle do?
Currently, sle cannot be actually used to make any games. However, it does have a couple of features:
- An Entity Component System (secs).
- A custom tile map editor with some custom tile sprites.
- A (still incomplete) map serializer.

# What are some goals of sle?
- Finish the secs Entity Component System.
- Write a full scene serializer with a custom (most likely text) format.
- Extend secs' components and systems to be able to have enough for creating games.
